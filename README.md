# Kelvin Weather Project for dev30

## Step 1

+ The forecast today is 293 Kelvin. To start, create a variable named kelvin, and set it equal to 293.

+ The value saved to kelvin will stay constant. Choose the variable type with this in mind.

## Step 2

+ Write a comment above that explains this line of code.

## Step 3

+ Celsius is similar to Kelvin — the only difference is that Celsius is 273 degrees less than Kelvin.

+ Let’s convert Kelvin to Celsius by subtracting 273 from the kelvin variable. Store the result in another variable, named celsius.

## Step 4

+ Write a comment above that explains this line of code.

## Step 5

+ Use this equation to calculate Fahrenheit, then store the answer in a variable named fahrenheit.

+ Fahrenheit = Celsius \* (9/5) + 32

+ In the next step we will round the number saved to fahrenheit. Choose the variable type that allows you to change its value.

## Step 6

+ Write a comment above that explains this line of code.

## Step 7

+ When you convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit, you often get a decimal number.

Use the .floor() method from the built-in Math object to round down the Fahrenheit temperature. Save the result to the fahrenheit variable.

## Step 8

+ Write a comment above that explains this line of code.

## Step 9

+ Use console.log and string interpolation to log the temperature in fahrenheit to the console as follows:

+ The temperature is TEMPERATURE degrees Fahrenheit.

+ Use string interpolation to replace TEMPERATURE with the value saved to fahrenheit.

## Step 10

+ Run your program to see your results!

## Step 11

+ By using variables, your program should work for any Kelvin temperature — just change the value of kelvin and run the program again.

+ What’s 0 Kelvin in Fahrenheit?

## Step 12 - Extra Credit

- Convert celsius to the Newton scale using the equation below:

- Newton = Celsius * (33/100)

- Round down the Newton temperature using the .floor() method

- Use console.log and string interpolation to log the temperature in newton to the console
